The `MAP Client`_ is a cross-platform framework for managing workflows. MAP Client is a plugin-based application that can be used to create workflows from a collection of workflow steps.  Each workflow step is simply a plugin for the MAP Client which performs a basic task.  Each workflow step is broken down to be as general as possible to make it as reusable by other users and developers. 

One of the central ideas for the MAP Client is to allow users to easily develop and share there own plugins that can be used in a workflow.  Having users create and share their plugins increases the power of the MAP Client so that it doesn't rely on a central team of developers. 

The MAP Client is an application written in Python and based on Qt the cross-platform application and UI framework.  Further details are available in the documents listed below.
